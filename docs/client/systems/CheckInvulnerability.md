# CheckInvulnerability

The "CheckInvulnerability" system is responsible for managing the invulnerability of attackable entities in the game. It controls the duration of invulnerability for entities after taking damage, thus controlling the frequency of possible attacks.

This system checks the time elapsed since the last attack received by attackable entities and restores their ability to be attacked once the invulnerability time has passed.

## Features
The "CheckInvulnerability" system performs the following actions:
- Checks the invulnerability time of attackable entities.
- Restores the ability to be attacked after the invulnerability time has passed.

## Example Usage
The "CheckInvulnerability" system is used to manage the invulnerability time of attackable entities in the game:

```cpp
// Using the CheckInvulnerability system
Client::Systems::CheckInvulnerability(core);
```
